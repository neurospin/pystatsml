    "## Overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistics and machine learning, overfitting occurs when a statistical model describes random errors or noise instead of the underlying relationships. Overfitting generally occurs when a model is **excessively complex**, such as having **too many parameters relative to the number of observations**. A model that has been overfit will generally have poor predictive performance, as it can exaggerate minor fluctuations in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A learning algorithm is trained using some set of training samples. If the learning algorithm has the capacity to overfit the training samples the performance on the **training sample set** will improve while the performance on unseen **test sample set** will decline.\n",

    "The overfitting phenomenon has three main explanations:\n",
    " - excessively complex models,\n",
    " - multicollinearity, and\n",
    " - high dimensionality.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multicollinearity\n",
    "\n",
    "Predictors are highly correlated, meaning that one can be linearly predicted from the others. In this situation the coefficient estimates of the multiple regression may change erratically in response to small changes in the model or the data. Multicollinearity does not reduce the predictive power or reliability of the model as a whole, at least not within the sample data set; it only affects computations regarding individual predictors. That is, a multiple regression model with correlated predictors can indicate how well the entire bundle of predictors predicts the outcome variable, but it may not give valid results about any individual predictor, or about which predictors are redundant with respect to others. In case of perfect multicollinearity the predictor matrix is singular and therefore cannot be inverted. Under these circumstances, for a general linear model $\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{w} + \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$, the ordinary least-squares estimator, $\\mathbf{w}_{OLS} = (\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{y}$, does not exist.\n",

    "However, taxes = 20% of bv (tax and bv are highly collinear), therefore there is an infinite number of linear combinations of tax and bv that lead to the same prediction. Solutions with very large coefficients will produce excessively large predictions."

Linear predictor associate one parameter to each input feature, so a high-dimensional situation ($P$, number of features, is large) with a relatively small number of samples $N$ (so-called large $P$ small $N$ situation) generally lead to an overfit of the training data. Thus it is generally a bad idea to add many input features into the learner. This phenomenon is called the **curse of dimensionality**.\n",

    "## Regularization using penalization of coeffients\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding linear models, overfitting generally leads to excessively complex solutions (coefficient vectors), accounting for noise or spurious correlations within predictors. **Regularization** aims to alleviate this phenomenon by constraining (biasing or reducing) the capacity of the learning algorithm in order to promote simple solutions. Regularization penalizes \"large\" solutions forcing the coefficients to be small, i.e. to shrink them toward zeros.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective function $J(\\mathbf{w})$ to minimize with respect to $\\mathbf{w}$ is composed of a loss function $L(\\mathbf{w})$ for goodness-of-fit and a penalty term $\\Omega(\\mathbf{w})$ (regularization to avoid overfitting). This is a trade-off where the respective contribution of the loss and the penalty terms is controlled by the regularization parameter $\\lambda$.\n",

The number of predictive features is always 10% of the total number of input features. Therefore, the signal to noise ratio (SNR) increases by increasing the number of input features. The performances on the training set rapidly reach 100% (R2=1). However, the performance on the test set decreases with the increase of the input dimensionality.
