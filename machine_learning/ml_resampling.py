# Train, validation and test sets
# -------------------------------
#
# Machine learning algorithms overfit taining data. Predictive performances **MUST** be evaluated on independant hold-out dataset.
#
# .. figure:: ../images/train_val_test_cv.png
#    :alt: Train, validation and test sets.
#
# 1. **Training dataset**: Dataset used to fit the model
#    (set the model parameters like weights). The *training error* can be
#    easily calculated by applying the statistical learning method to the
#    observations used in its training. But because of overfitting, the
#    **training error rate can dramatically underestimate the error** that
#    would be obtained on new samples.
# 2. **Validation dataset**: Dataset used to provide an unbiased evaluation
#    of a model fit on the training dataset while
#    **tuning model hyperparameters**, ie. **model selection**.
#    The validation error is the average error that results from a learning
#    method to predict the response on a new (validation) samples that is,
#    on samples that were not used in training the method.
# 3. **Test dataset**: Dataset used to provide an unbiased
#    **evaluation of a final model** fitted on the training dataset.
#    It is only used once a model is completely trained (using the train and
#    validation sets).
#
# What is the Difference Between Test and Validation Datasets? by
# [Jason Brownlee](https://machinelearningmastery.com/difference-test-validation-datasets/)
#
# Thus the original dataset is generally split in a training, validation and a
# test data sets. Large training+validation set (80%) small test set (20%) might
# provide a poor estimation of the predictive performances (same argument
# stands for train vs validation samples). On the contrary, large test set and
# small training set might produce a poorly estimated learner.
# This is why, on situation where we cannot afford such split, cross-validation
# scheme can be use for model selection or/and for model evaluation.
#
# If sample size is limited, train/validation/test split may not be possible.
# **Cross Validation (CV)** (see below) can be used to replace:
#
# - Outer (train/test) split of model evaluation.
# - Inner train/validation split of model selection (more frequent situation).
# - Inner and outer splits, leading to two nested CV.

# Train/validation/test splits: model selection and model evaluation
# ------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The **Grid search procedure** (`GridSearchCV`) performs a
# model selection of the best **hyper-parameters** :math:`\alpha` over a grid of possible values.
# Train set is  "splitted (inner split) into train/validation sets.
#
# **Model selection with grid search procedure:**
#
# 1. Fit the learner (\ie. estimate **parameters** :math:`\mathbf{\Omega}_k`)
#    on training set: :math:`\mathbf{X}_{train}, \mathbf{y}_{train} \rightarrow f_{\alpha_k, \mathbf{\Omega}_k}(.)`
# 2. Evaluate the model on the validation set and keep the hyper-parameter(s) that
#    minimises the error measure :math:`\alpha_* = \arg \min L(f_{\alpha_k, \mathbf{\Omega}_k}(\mathbf{X}_{val}), \mathbf{y}_{val})`
# 3. Refit the learner on all training + validation data,
#    :math:`\mathbf{X}_{train \cup val}, \mathbf{y}_{train \cup val}`,
#    using the best hyper parameters (:math:`\alpha_*`): :math:`\rightarrow f_{\alpha_*, \mathbf{\Omega}_*}(.)`
#
# **Model evaluation:** on the test set:
# :math:`L(f_{\alpha_*, \mathbf{\Omega}_*}(\mathbf{X}_{test}), \mathbf{y}_{test})`

# %%
# Cross-Validation (CV)
# ---------------------
#
# If sample size is limited, train/validation/test split may not be possible.
# **Cross Validation (CV)** can be used to replace train/validation split
# and/or train+validation / test split.
#
# Cross-Validation scheme randomly divides the set of observations into
# *K* groups, or **folds**, of approximately equal size.
# The first fold is treated as a validation set, and the method
# :math:`f()` is fitted on the remaining union of *K - 1* folds:
# (:math:`f(\boldsymbol{X}_{-K}, \boldsymbol{y}_{-K})`).
# The measure of performance (the score function :math:`\mathcal{S}`),
# either a error measure or an correct prediction measure is an average
# of a loss error or correct prediction measure, noted :math:`\mathcal{L}`,
# between a true target value and the predicted target value.
# The score function is evaluated of the on the observations in the held-out
# fold. For each sample *i* we consider the model estimated
# :math:`f(\boldsymbol{X}_{-k(i)}, \boldsymbol{y}_{-k(i)}` on the data set
# without the group *k* that contains *i* noted *-k(i)*.
# This procedure is repeated *K* times; each time, a different group of
# observations is treated as a test set.
# Then we compare the predicted value
# (:math:`f_{-k(i)}(\boldsymbol{x}_i) = \hat{y_i})`
# with true value :math:`y_i` using a Error or Loss function
# :math:`\mathcal{L}(y, \hat{y})`.
#
# For 10-fold we can either average over 10 values (Macro measure) or
# concatenate the 10 experiments and compute the micro measures.
#
# Two strategies [micro vs macro estimates](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/34611/meanscores-vs-scoreconcatenation-in-cross-validation):
#
# - **Micro measure: average(individual scores)**: compute a score
#   :math:`\mathcal{S}` for each sample and average over all samples.
#   It is simillar to **average score(concatenation)**: an averaged score
#   computed over all concatenated samples.
#
# .. raw:: latex
#    \mathcal{S}(f) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_i^N \mathcal{L}\left(y_i, f(\boldsymbol{x}_{-k(i)}, \boldsymbol{y}_{-k(i)}) \right).
#
# - **Macro measure mean(CV scores)** (the most commonly used method):
#   compute a score :math:`\mathcal{S}` on each each fold *k* and average
#   accross folds:
#
# .. raw:: latex
#    \begin{align*}
#    \mathcal{S}(f) &= \frac{1}{K} \sum_k^K \mathcal{S}_k(f).\\
#    \mathcal{S}(f) &= \frac{1}{K} \sum_k^K \frac{1}{N_k} \sum_{i \in k} \mathcal{L}\left(y_i, f(\boldsymbol{x}_{-k(i)}, \boldsymbol{y}_{-k(i)}) \right).
#    \end{align*}
#
# These two measures (an average of average vs. a global average) are generaly
# similar. They may differ slightly is folds are of different sizes.
# This validation scheme is known as the **K-Fold CV**.
# Typical choices of *K* are 5 or 10, [Kohavi 1995].
# The extreme case where *K = N* is known as **leave-one-out cross-validation,
# LOO-CV**.

# Random Permutations: sample the null distribution
# -------------------------------------------------
#
# A permutation test is a type of non-parametric randomization test in which the null distribution of a test statistic is estimated by randomly permuting the observations.
#
# Permutation tests are highly attractive because they make no assumptions other than that the observations are independent and identically distributed under the null hypothesis.
#
# 1. Compute a observed statistic :math:`t_{obs}` on the data.
# 2. Use randomization to compute the distribution of :math:`t` under the null hypothesis: Perform :math:`N` random permutation of the data. For each sample of permuted data, :math:`i` the data compute the statistic :math:`t_i`. This procedure provides the distribution of *t* under the null hypothesis :math:`H_0`: :math:`P(t \vert H_0)`
# 3. Compute the p-value = :math:`P(t>t_{obs} | H_0) \left\vert\{t_i > t_{obs}\}\right\vert`, where :math:`t_i's include :math:`t_{obs}`.
#

#
# Sample the distributions of r-squared and coefficients of ridge regression under the null hypothesis. Simulated dataset:

# Regression dataset where first 2 features are predictives

# Bootstrapping
# -------------
#
# Bootstrapping is a statistical technique which consists in generating sample (called bootstrap samples) from an initial dataset of size *N* by randomly drawing with replacement *N* observations. It provides sub-samples with the same distribution than the original dataset. It aims to:
#
# 1. Assess the variability (standard error, [confidence intervals.](https://sebastianraschka.com/blog/2016/model-evaluation-selection-part2.html#the-bootstrap-method-and-empirical-confidence-intervals)) of performances scores or estimated parameters (see Efron et al. 1986).
# 2. Regularize model by fitting several models on bootstrap samples and averaging their predictions (see Baging and random-forest).
#
# A great advantage of bootstrap is its simplicity. It is a straightforward way to derive estimates of standard errors and confidence intervals for complex estimators of complex parameters of the distribution, such as percentile points, proportions, odds ratio, and correlation coefficients.
#
# 1. Perform :math:`B` sampling, with replacement, of the dataset.
# 2. For each sample :math:`i` fit the model and compute the scores.
# 3. Assess standard errors and confidence intervals of scores using the scores obtained on the :math:`B` resampled dataset. Or, average models predictions.
