    "1. **Training dataset**: Dataset used to fit the model (set the model parameters like weights). The *training error* can be easily calculated by applying the statistical learning method to the observations used in its training. But because of overfitting, the **training error rate can dramatically underestimate the error** that would be obtained on new samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Validation dataset**: Dataset used to provide an unbiased evaluation of a model fit on the training dataset while **tuning model hyperparameters**. The validation error is the average error that results from a learning method to predict the response on a new (validation) samples that is, on samples that were not used in training the method. \n",

Large training+validation set (80%) small test set (20%) might provide a poor estimation of the predictive performances (same argument stands for train vs validation samples). On the contrary, large test set and small training set might produce a poorly estimated learner. This is why, on situation where we cannot afford such split, it recommended to use cross-validation scheme to estimate the predictive power of a learning algorithm.\n",

    "Cross-Validation scheme randomly divides the set of observations into $K$ groups, or **folds**, of approximately equal size.

    "The measure of performance (the score function $\\mathcal{S}$), either a error measure or an correct prediction measure is an average of a loss error or correct prediction measure, noted $\\mathcal{L}$, between a true target value and the predicted target value. The score function is evaluated of the on the observations in the held-out fold. For each sample $i$ we consider the model estimated $f(\\boldsymbol{X}_{-k(i)}, \\boldsymbol{y}_{-k(i)}$ on the data set without the group $k$ that contains $i$ noted $-k(i)$. This procedure is repeated $K$ times; each time, a different group of observations is treated as a test set.\n",
    "Then we compare the predicted value ($f_{-k(i)}(\\boldsymbol{x}_i) = \\hat{y_i})$ with true value $y_i$ using a Error or Loss function $\\mathcal{L}(y, \\hat{y})$.\n",
